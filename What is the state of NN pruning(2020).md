## What is the state of nn pruning?

Many inconsistencies across models, datasets, metrics etc. across the surveyed papers. Model-dataset combinations are also usually not reused. Different train-finetune schedules etc.

Authors propose shrinkBench.
Also, section 6 has some nice recommendations for designing pruning experiments.
